## 🗂 Repository Structure
The solutions are organized in folders based on their problem number and category (if applicable). Each solution includes:
- The **problem number** and **title** as a comment at the beginning of the file.
- A **brief explanation** (when necessary).
- The **code solution** implemented in C (and possibly other languages in the future).

Example structure:
```
